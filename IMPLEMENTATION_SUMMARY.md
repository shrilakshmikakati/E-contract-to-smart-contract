✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: New Accuracy Display Behavior

🎯 CHANGES SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED:
=====================================

1. 📝 SMART CONTRACT GENERATION (No Accuracy Display):
   ✅ Removed accuracy score from generation success message
   ✅ Added "Use 'Compare Contracts' to see accuracy analysis"
   ✅ Contract code is displayed FIRST in generation results
   ✅ Removed accuracy from generation display summary
   ✅ Basic validation info shown without accuracy scores

2. 📊 COMPARISON PHASE (Accuracy Analysis Added):
   ✅ Enhanced comparison results with "ACCURACY ANALYSIS" section
   ✅ Shows accuracy FIRST in comparison results
   ✅ Displays Smart Contract Generation Accuracy percentage
   ✅ Added accuracy interpretation (Excellent/Good/Fair/Low)
   ✅ Knowledge graph comparison with entity preservation rates
   ✅ Deployment readiness indicator

3. 🔄 USER FLOW:
   ✅ Generation: Contract Type + Code Display + "Use Compare for Accuracy"
   ✅ Comparison: Accuracy Analysis + Knowledge Graph Metrics + Detailed Results

📋 VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION:
- ✅ Success message guides users to comparison for accuracy
- ✅ Generation display prioritizes contract code over metrics
- ✅ Accuracy analysis integrated into comparison phase
- ✅ Knowledge graph accuracy comparison included

🎉 RESULT: 
The system now behaves exactly as requested:
• Contract code shows FIRST during generation (no accuracy displayed)
• Accuracy analysis appears ONLY during comparison phase
• Users get comprehensive accuracy metrics when comparing contracts
